## 🏝️ Inspiration

*Beach Day* brings the serenity of a perfect beach day to your coding setup. Think golden hour lighting, the sound of gentle waves, and that perfect spot under an umbrella where the WiFi somehow still works. It's all the relaxation of a beach vacation with none of the sand-in-keyboard anxiety.

Perfect for developers who believe the best code is written with a mental soundtrack of ocean waves and the occasional seagull. Now you can have that "coding by the shore" aesthetic without worrying about salt air corroding those Type-C ports.
